Overview
This project involves creating site pages and basic markup for a website that lists financial market analysis articles. The Index page is designed using React-router to display a list of article titles. Initially, static data is used, but in this phase, the pages are made dynamic by integrating with the real-time Google Firebase repository. Users can now add and modify articles through the website.
